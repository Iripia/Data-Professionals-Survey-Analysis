### Project Overview
This data professional survey analysis aims to identify potential areas for improvement in
diversity, employee well-being, and overall satisfaction to enhance the overall work environment.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handing missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Scenario used: As an Analyst at a tech company, I was tasked with conducting an annual review of employee satisfaction and compensation. My goal was to identify potential areas for improvement, analyze the average salary by gender to ensure fair compensation practices and access happiness with management, while also exploring the preferred programming languages for different data roles. This can inform decisions on skill development initiatives. Finally, understanding the education levels can help tailor professional development opportunities.

# The following questions were answered:
1. Average Salary by Gender and Job Title
2. Preferred programming languages for various data-related roles?
3. How difficult was it for you to break into tech, considering factors like education and
skills?
4. How satisfied are you with your salary, taking into account personal experiences and
expectations?

### Results/Findings
1. Data Scientists earn more in the data profession, and Python seems to be the favorite
programming language of all data professionals.
2. Only 24.92% of data professionals are happy with their salary while 42.06% are not
happy and 31.9% remain neutral
3. 34.6% are happy with their management, 24.44% are not happy, and 39.06 remain
neutral
4. Most data professionals have a bachelorâ€™s degree, and most people found it neither
difficult nor easy to break into tech.

### Recommendations
1. I recommend conducting a detailed analysis to identify factors contributing to
salary dissatisfaction among data professionals. This could involve exploring
industry benchmarks, assessing job responsibilities, and understanding individual
expectations.
2. Suggest establishing regular channels for employees to provide feedback on
management practices. Encourage an open and transparent feedback culture,
enabling management to address concerns and make improvements based on
the team's input.
3. Propose introducing leadership development programs to enhance management
skills within the data profession. Investing in the professional growth of managers
can contribute to improved employee satisfaction and a positive work
environment.

### Limitation
These insights are based on the responses of only 630 data professionals
hence, cannot be generalized.
